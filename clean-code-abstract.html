        <p>
            <blockquote>
                Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and practising.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it, practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions the wrong way.

        <h2>The Boy Scout Rule</h2>
        <p>
            It’s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We must take an active role in preventing this degradation.</br>
            The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule that we can apply to our profession. </p>

        <blockquote>Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.</blockquote>
        <p>
            If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot. </br>
            The cleanup doesn’t have to be something big. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that’s a little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite <code>if</code> statement.
        </p>

        <h1>Chapter 2: Meaningful Names</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Names are everywhere in software. We name our variables, our functions, our arguments, classes, and packages. Because we do so much of it, we’d better do it well. What follows are some simple rules for creating good names.
        </p>
        <h2>Use Intention-Revealing Names</h2>
        <p>
            Names should reveal intent. Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes. So, take care with your names and change them when you find better ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
int d; // elapsed time in days
</code>

        <p>
            The name <code>d</code> reveals nothing. It does not evoke a sense of elapsed time, nor of days. We should choose a name that specifies what is being measured and the unit of that measurement:
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
int elapsedTimeInDays;
int daysSinceCreation;
int daysSinceModification;
int fileAgeInDays;
</code>

        <p>
            Choosing names that reveal intent can make it much easier to understand and change code. 
        </p>
        
    </div>


    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
<p>What is the purpose of this code?</p>
<code class="code-block">
 public List<int[]> getThem() {
 	List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<int[]>();
 	for (int[] x : theList)
 		if (x[0] == 4) 
 			list1.add(x);
 		return list1;
 }
</code>
        <p>
            Why is it hard to tell what this code is doing? Even though there are no complex expressions, and just three variables and two constants mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem isn’t the simplicity of the code, but the implicity of the code: the degree to which the context is not explicit in the code itself. The code implicitly requires that we know the answers to questions such as:
            <ul style="list-style:decimal">
                <li>What kinds of things are in <code>theList</code>?</li>
                <li>What is the significance of the zeroth subscript of an item in <code>theList</code>?</li>
                <li>What is the significance of the value 4?</li>
                <li>How would I use the list being returned?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The answers to these questions are not present in the code sample, but they could have been. Say, that we’re working in a mine sweeper game. We find that the board is a list of cells called <code>theList</code>. Let’s rename that to <code>gameBoard</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each cell on the board is represented by a simple array. We further find that the zeroth subscript is the location of a status value and that a status value of 4 means "flagged." Just by giving these concepts names, we can improve the code considerably:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
 public List<int[]> getFlaggedCells() {
 	List<int[]> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<int[]>();
 	for (int[] cell : gameBoard)
 		if (cell[STATUS_VALUE] == FLAGGED)
 			flaggedCells.add(cell);
 		return flaggedCells;
 }
</code>
        <p>
            Notice that the simplicity of the code has not changed. It still has exactly the same number of operators and constants, with exactly the same number of nesting levels. But the code has become much more explicit.
        </p>        
    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
<p>
            We can go further and write a simple class for cells instead of using an array of ints. It can include an intention-revealing function (call it <code>isFlagged</code>) to hide the magic numbers. It results in a new version of the function:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {
	List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();
	for (Cell cell : gameBoard)
		if (cell.isFlagged())
			flaggedCells.add(cell);
		return flaggedCells;
}
</code>
        <p>
            With these simple name changes, it’s not difficult to understand what’s going on. This is the power of choosing good names.
        </p>

        <h2>Avoid Disinformation</h2>
        <p>
            Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning. </br>
For example, <i>hp</i>, <i>aix</i>, and <i>sco</i> would be poor variable names because they are the names of Unix platforms or variants. Even if you are coding a hypotenuse and <i>hp</i> looks like a good abbreviation, it could be disinformative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an <i>accountList</i> unless it’s actually a List. The word <i>list</i> means something specific to programmers. </br>
If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to false conclusions <i>[As we’ll see later on, even if the container is a List, it’s probably better not to encode the container type into the name]</i>. 
</br>So, <i>accountGroup</i> or <i>bunchOfAccounts</i> or just plain <i>accounts</i> would be better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beware of using names which vary in small ways. How long does it take to spot the subtle difference between a <i>XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings</i> in one module and, somewhere a little more distant, <i>XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings</i>? The words have frightfully similar shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spelling similar concepts similarly is information. Using inconsistent spellings is disinformation.
        </p>
        
    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
<p>
            A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case <code>L</code> or uppercase <code>O</code> as variable names, especially in combination. The problem, of course, is that they look almost entirely like the constants one and zero, respectively.
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
int a = l;
if (O == l )
	a = O1;
else
	l = 01;
</code>
        <h2>Make Meaningful Distinctions</h2>
        <p>
            Programmers create problems for themselves when they write code solely to satisfy a compiler or interpreter. For example, because you can’t use the same name to refer to two different things in the same scope, you might be tempted to change one name in an arbitrary way. Sometimes this is done by misspelling one, leading to the surprising situation where correcting spelling errors leads to an inability to compile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider, for example, the truly hideous practice of creating a variable named <i>klass</i> just because the name <i>class</i> was used for something else.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not sufficient to add number series or noise words, even though the compiler is satisfied. If names must be different, then they should also mean something different.
        </p>
        <p>
            Number-series naming <i>(a1, a2, .. aN)</i> is the opposite of intentional naming. Such names are not disinformative—they are noninformative; they provide no clue to the author’s intention. Consider:
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
public static void copyChars(char a1[], char a2[]) {
	for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
		a2[i] = a1[i]; 
	}
}
</code>
        <p>
            This function reads much better when <i>source</i> and <i>destination</i> are used for the argument names.
        </p>
        <p>
            Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a <i>Product</i> class. If you have another called <i>ProductInfo</i> or <i>ProductData</i>, you have made the names different without making them mean anything different. <i>Info</i> and <i>Data</i> are indistinct noise words like <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, and <i>the</i>.
        </p>
        
    </div>


    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
<p>
            Note that there is nothing wrong with using prefix conventions like <i>a</i> and <i>the</i> so long as they make a meaningful distinction. 
<br>For example, you might use <i>a</i> for all local variables and <i>the</i> for all function arguments. The problem comes in when you decide to call a variable <i>theZork</i> because you already have another variable named <i>zork</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Noise words are redundant. The word <i>variable</i> should never appear in a variable name. The word <i>table</i> should never appear in a table name. How is <i>NameString</i> better than
            <i>Name</i>? Would a <i>Name</i> ever be a floating point number? If so, it breaks an earlier rule about disinformation. Imagine finding one class named <i>Customer</i> and another named
            <i>CustomerObject</i>. What should you understand as the distinction? Which one will represent the best path to a customer’s payment history?
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider an application, which has these methods:
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
getActiveAccount();
getActiveAccounts();
getActiveAccountInfo();
</code>
        <p>
            How are the programmers in this project supposed to know which of these functions to call?
        </p>
        <p>
            In the absence of specific conventions, </br>
            the variable <i>moneyAmount</i> is indistinguishable from <i>money</i>. </br>
            <i>customerInfo</i> is indistinguishable from <i>customer</i>. </br>
            <i>accountData</i> is indistinguishable from <i>account</i>. </br>
            <i>theMessage</i> is indistinguishable from <i>message</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.
        </p>

        <h2>Use Pronounceable Names</h2>
        <p>
            Humans are good at words. A significant part of our brains is dedicated to the concept of words. And words are, by definition, pronounceable. It would be a shame not to take advantage of that huge portion of our brains that has evolved to deal with spoken language. So make your names pronounceable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine a property was named <code>genymdhms</code> (to represent generation date, year, month, day, hour, minute, and second)
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
        <p>
            Compare
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
class DtaRcrd102 {
	private Date genymdhms; 
	private Date modymdhms;
	private final String pszqint = "102";
	/* ... */
};
</code>
        <p>
            to
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
class Customer {
	private Date generationTimestamp; 
	private Date modificationTimestamp;;
	private final String recordId = "102";
	/* ... */
};
</code>

        <h2>Use Searchable Names</h2>
        <p>
            Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.
        </p>
        <p>
            One might easily grep for <i>MAX_CLASSES_PER_STUDENT</i>, but the number 7 could be more troublesome. Searches may turn up the digit as part of file names, other constant definitions, and in various expressions where the value is used with different intent. It is even worse when a constant is a long number and someone might have transposed digits, thereby creating a bug while simultaneously evading the programmer’s search.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, the name <code>e</code> is a poor choice for any variable for which a programmer might need to search. It is the most common letter in the English language and likely to show up in every passage of text in every program. In this regard, longer names trump shorter names, and any searchable name trumps a constant in code.
        </p>
        <p>
            My personal preference is that single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods. The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a variable or constant might be seen or used in multiple places in a body of code, it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
        <p>Once again compare</p>
        <code class="code-block">
for (int j=0; j<34; j++) {
	s += (t[j]*4)/5;
}
</code>
        <p>
            to
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
int realDaysPerIdealDay = 4;
const int WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5;
int sum = 0;
for (int j=0; j < NUMBER_OF_TASKS; j++) {
  int realTaskDays = taskEstimate[j] * realDaysPerIdealDay;
  int realTaskWeeks = (realdays / WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK);
  sum += realTaskWeeks;
}
</code>
        <p>
            Note that sum, above, is not a particularly useful name but at least is searchable. The intentionally named code makes for a longer function, but consider how much easier it will be to find <code>WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK</code> than to find all the places where 5 was used and filter the list down to just the instances with the intended meaning.
        </p>

        <h2>Avoid Encodings</h2>
        <p>
            We have enough encodings to deal with, without adding more to our burden. Encoding type or scope information into names simply adds an extra burden of deciphering. It is an unnecessary mental burden when trying to solve a problem.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encoded names are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type.</li>
            <li>They make it harder to change the name or type of a variable, function, or class.</li>
            <li>They make it harder to read the code. </li>
            <li>And they create the possibility that the encoding system will mislead the reader.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here is a bad code example, where the variable name was not changed when its type was changed!
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
PhoneNumber phoneString; 
</code>
    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
        <h2>Member Prefixes</h2>
        <p>
            You also don’t need to prefix member variables with <code>m_</code> anymore. Your classes and functions should be small enough that you don’t need them. And you should be using an editing environment that highlights or colorizes members to make them distinct.
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
public class Part { 
	private String m_dsc; // The textual description
	void setName(String name) {
		m_dsc = name;
	}
}
</code>
        <hr>
        <code class="code-block">
public class Part { 
	String description;
	void setDescription(String description) { 
		this.description = description;
	}
}
</code>
        <p>
            Besides, people quickly learn to ignore the prefix (or suffix) to see the meaningful part of the name. The more we read the code, the less we see the prefixes. Eventually the prefixes become unseen clutter and a marker of older code.
        </p>
        <h2>Interfaces and Implementations</h2>
        <p>
            These are sometimes a special case for encodings. For example, say you are building an ABSTRACT FACTORY for the creation of shapes. This factory will be an interface and will be implemented by a concrete class. What should you name them? <i>IShapeFactory</i> and <i>ShapeFactory</i>?

        <p>
            I prefer to leave interfaces unadorned. The preceding <code>I</code>, so common in today’s legacy wads, is a distraction at best and too much information at worst. I don’t want my users knowing that I’m handing them an interface. I just want them to know that it’s a <i>ShapeFactory</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if I must encode either the interface or the implementation, I choose the implementation. Calling it <i>ShapeFactoryImp</i>, or even the hideous <i>CShapeFactory</i>, is preferable to encoding the interface.

        <h2>Avoid Mental Mapping</h2>
        <p>
            Readers shouldn’t have to mentally translate your names into other names they already know. This problem generally arises from a choice to use neither problem domain terms nor solution domain terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a problem with single-letter variable names. Certainly a loop counter may be named <code>i</code> or <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> if its scope is very small and no other names can conflict with it. This is because those single-letter names for loop counters are traditional. However, in most other contexts a single-letter name is a poor choice; it’s just a place holder that the reader must mentally map to the actual concept. There can be no worse reason for using the name <code>c</code> than because <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> were already taken.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general programmers are pretty smart people. Smart people sometimes like to show off their smarts by demonstrating their mental juggling abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            One difference between a smart programmer and a professional programmer is that the professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.
        </p>
        <h2>Class Names</h2>
        <p>
            Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, WikiPage, Account, and AddressParser. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.
        </p>
        <h2>Method Names</h2>
        <p>
            Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like <i>postPayment</i>, <i>deletePage</i>, or <i>save</i>. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value and prefixed with <i>get</i>, <i>set</i>, and is according to the javabean standard.
        </p>

        <code class="code-block">
string name = employee.getName();
customer.setName("mike");
if (paycheck.isPosted())...
</code>

    </div>


    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
        <p>
            When constructors are overloaded, use static factory methods with names that describe the arguments. For example,
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
Complex fulcrumPoint = Complex.FromRealNumber(23.0);
</code>
        <p>
            is generally better than
        </p>
        <code class="code-block">
Complex fulcrumPoint = new Complex(23.0);
</code>
        <p>
            Consider enforcing their use by making the corresponding constructors private.
        </p>

        <h2>Don’t Be Cute</h2>
        <p>

            If names are too clever, they will be memorable only to people who share the author’s sense of humour, and only as long as these people remember the joke. Will they know what the function named <i>HolyHandGrenade</i> is supposed to do? </br>
            Sure, it’s cute, but maybe in this case <i>DeleteItems</i> might be a better name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Choose clarity over entertainment value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cuteness in code often appears in the form of colloquialisms or slang. 
</br>For example, don’t use the name <i>whack()</i> to mean <i>kill()</i>. Don’t tell little culture-dependent jokes like <i>eatMyShorts()</i> to mean <i>abort()</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
        </p>

        <h2>Pick One Word per Concept</h2>
        <p>
            Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. 
</br>For instance, it’s confusing to have <i>fetch</i>, <i>retrieve</i>, and <i>get</i> as equivalent methods of different classes. 
</br>How do you remember which method name goes with which class? Sadly, you often have to remember which company, group, or individual wrote the library or class in order to remember which term was used. Otherwise, you spend an awful lot of time browsing through headers and previous code samples.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
        <p>
            The function names have to stand alone, and they have to be consistent in order for you to pick the correct method without any additional exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, it’s confusing to have a <i>controller</i> and a <i>manager</i> and a <i>driver</i> in the same code base. 
</br>What is the essential difference between a <i>DeviceManager</i> and a <i>ProtocolController</i>? Why are both not <i>controllers</i> or both not <i>managers</i>? Are they both <i>Drivers</i> really? The name leads you to expect two objects that have very different type as well as having different classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.
        </p>

        <h2>Don’t Pun</h2>
        <p>
            Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you follow the "one word per concept" rule, you could end up with many classes that have, for example, an add method. As long as the parameter lists and return values of the various add methods are semantically equivalent, all is well.
        </p>

        <p>
            However one might decide to use the word <i>add</i> for "consistency" when he or she is not in fact adding in the same sense. Let's say we have many classes where <i>add</i> will create a new value by adding or concatenating two existing values. 
</p>
<p>
Now let’s say we are writing a new class that has a method that puts its single parameter into a collection. Should we call this method <i>add</i>? 
</br>It might seem consistent because we have so many other <i>add</i> methods, but in this case, the semantics are different, so we should use a name like <i>insert</i> or <i>append</i> instead. To call the new method <i>add</i> would be a pun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal, as authors, is to make our code as easy as possible to understand. We want our code to be a quick skim, not an intense study. We want to use the popular paperback model whereby the author is responsible for making himself clear and not the academic model where it is the scholar’s job to dig the meaning out of the paper.
        </p>

        <h2>Use Solution Domain Names</h2>
        <p>
            Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So, go ahead and use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth. It is not wise to draw every name from the problem domain because we don’t want our coworkers to have to run back and forth to the customer asking what every name means when they already know the concept by a different name.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
        <p>
            The name <i>AccountVisitor</i> means a great deal to a programmer who is familiar with the VISITOR pattern. What programmer would not know what a <i>JobQueue</i> was? There are lots of very technical things that programmers have to do. Choosing technical names for those things is usually the most appropriate course.
        </p>

        <h2>Use Problem Domain Names</h2>
        <p>
            When there is no "programmer-eese" for what you’re doing, use the name from the problem domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert what it means.</br>
            Separating solution and problem domain concepts is part of the job of a good programmer and designer. The code that has more to do with problem domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain.
        </p>

        <h2>Add Meaningful Context</h2>
        <p>
            There are a few names which are meaningful in and of themselves—most are not. Instead, you need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine that you have variables named <i>firstName</i>, <i>lastName</i>, <i>street</i>, <i>houseNumber</i>, <i>city</i>, <i>state</i>, and <i>zipcode</i>. Taken together it’s pretty clear that they form an address. But what if you just saw the <i>state</i> variable being used alone in a method? Would you automatically infer that it was part of an address?
        </p>
        <p>
            You can add context by using prefixes: <i>addrFirstName</i>, <i>addrLastName</i>, <i>addrState</i>, and so on. At least readers will understand that these variables are part of a larger structure. Of course, a better solution is to create a class named <i>Address</i>. Then, even the compiler knows that the variables belong to a bigger concept.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the method in <i>Listing 2-1</i>. Do the variables need a more meaningful context? The function name provides only part of the context; the algorithm provides the rest. Once you read through the function, you see that the three variables, <i>number</i>, <i>verb</i>, and <i>pluralModifier</i>, are part of the "guess statistics" message. Unfortunately, the context must be inferred. When you first look at the method, the meanings of the variables are opaque.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page bg-ch-2">
        <div class="page-num"></div>
        <strong>Listing 2-1 - Variables with unclear context.</strong>
        <code class="code-block">
private void printGuessStatistics(char candidate, int count) {
	String number;
	String verb;
	String pluralModifier;
	if (count == 0) {
		number = "no";
		verb = "are";
		pluralModifier = "s";
	} else if (count == 1) {
		number = "1";
		verb = "is";
		pluralModifier = "";
	} else {
		number = Integer.toString(count);
		verb = "are";
		pluralModifier = "s";
	}
	String guessMessage = String.format(
	"There %s %s %s%s", verb, number, candidate, pluralModifier
	);
	print(guessMessage);
}

</code>
        <p>
            The function is a bit too long and the variables are used throughout. To split the function into smaller pieces we need to create a <code>GuessStatisticsMessage</code> class and make the three variables fields of this class. This provides a clear context for the three variables. They are definitively part of the <code>GuessStatisticsMessage</code>. The improvement of context also allows the algorithm to be made much cleaner by breaking it into many smaller functions. (See <i>Listing 2-2</i>.)

        <h2>Don’t Add Gratuitous Context</h2>
        <p>
            In an imaginary application called "Gas Station Deluxe," it is a bad idea to prefix every class with <i>GSD</i>. Frankly, you are working against your tools. You type <code>G</code> and press the completion key and are rewarded with a mile-long list of every class in the system. Is that wise? Why make it hard for the IDE to help you?
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, say you invented a <i>MailingAddress</i> class in <i>GSD’s</i> accounting module, and you named it <i>GSDAccountAddress</i>. Later, you need a mailing address for your customer contact application. Do you use <i>GSDAccountAddress</i>? Does it sound like the right name? Ten of 17 characters are redundant or irrelevant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            The names <i>accountAddress</i> and <i>customerAddress</i> are fine names for instances of the class <i>Address</i> but could be poor names for classes. <i>Address</i> is a fine name for a class. If I need to differentiate between MAC addresses, port addresses, and Web addresses, I might consider <i>PostalAddress</i>, <i>MAC</i>, and <i>URI</i>. The resulting names are more precise, which is the point of all naming.
